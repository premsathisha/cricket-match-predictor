# Cricket Match Predictor

**IPL Match Predictor** is a machine learning project focused on predicting outcomes of IPL cricket matches at different stages: before the game begins, after the toss, mid-innings, and even after the full match concludes.

It’s a mix of sports analytics, practical ML experimentation, and a little curiosity about how well we can model a game that’s known for surprises.

## Why I’m Working On This

I’ve always enjoyed both cricket and coding, so this project was a natural way to combine the two. The main goals are:

- Applying machine learning to real-world sports data.
- Exploring how predictions change as more match context becomes available.
- Building something that’s both fun and technically useful for a portfolio.

## Data Source
This project uses IPL match data from [cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org/), an open-source cricket data platform.

## Future Plans
This project will be extended into a web app for interactive match predictions, making it accessible and engaging for others.
