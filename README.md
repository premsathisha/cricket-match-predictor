**IPL Match Predictor** is a machine learning project focused on predicting outcomes of IPL cricket matches at different stages: before the game begins, after the toss, mid-innings, and even after the full match concludes.

Itâ€™s a mix of sports analytics, practical ML experimentation, and a little curiosity about how well we can model a game thatâ€™s known for surprises.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Iâ€™m Working On This

Iâ€™ve always enjoyed both cricket and coding, so this project was a natural way to combine the two. The main goals are:

- Applying ML to real-world sports data.
- Exploring how predictions change as more match context becomes available.
- Building something thatâ€™s both fun and technically useful for a portfolio.
